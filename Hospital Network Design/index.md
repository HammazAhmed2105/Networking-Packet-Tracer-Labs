To start off we are told HQ and branch should have 1 core router each, each core router connecting to two L3 switches, which in turn connects to Several Access Layer switches. The core routers should also be connected to 2 ISPs. Theres a server site too, which will be connecting to the HQ core router directly. I amde a smple network using draw.io to understand what our final topology might look like.

- Before doing any sort of configurations we will first make the whole topology in cisco packet tracer.
