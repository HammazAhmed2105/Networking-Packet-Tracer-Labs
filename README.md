# Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs
This repo will have several labs on packet tracer.

**How to use this repository**
1 - There are several fully functional packet tracer lab files along with their respective word files. The word files contain all the explanation of the lab and what all I performed, how I subnetted, commands for VLans, asigning IP ADdresses and much more.
