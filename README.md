Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs
Welcome to the Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs repository! This repository contains a collection of Packet Tracer labs that I created as part of a mini project after clearing my CCNA in August 2024.

Overview
This repository includes several fully functional Packet Tracer lab files, each accompanied by a detailed Word document. The Word documents provide explanations of the lab setup, including:

Subnetting and IP Address assignment
VLAN configuration commands
Network security practices
Connectivity checks between end devices
And more...
How to Use This Repository
Download Lab Files: Each lab is provided with its respective Packet Tracer file (.pkt) and a Word document (.docx) containing detailed explanations and configurations.

Practice: You can use these files to practice the lab scenarios. Follow the instructions provided in the Word documents to understand the network setup, configurations, and verify connectivity between different devices.

Explore: Feel free to explore the configurations and make adjustments to enhance your understanding of networking concepts.

This structure should make it easier for others to understand how to use your repository effectively.
