# Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs

Welcome to the **Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs** repository! This repository contains a collection of Packet Tracer labs that I created as part of a mini project after clearing my CCNA in August 2024.

## Overview

This repository includes several fully functional Packet Tracer lab files, each accompanied by a detailed Word document. The Word documents provide explanations of the lab setup, including:

- Subnetting and IP Address assignment
- VLAN configuration commands
- Network security practices
- Connectivity checks between end devices
- And more...

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Download Lab Files**: Each lab is provided with its respective Packet Tracer file (.pkt) and a Word document (.docx) containing detailed explanations and configurations.

2. **Practice**: You can use these files to practice the lab scenarios. Follow the instructions provided in the Word documents to understand the network setup, configurations, and verify connectivity between different devices.

3. **Explore**: Feel free to explore the configurations and make adjustments to enhance your understanding of networking concepts.
4. **Using index.md**: Each folder has an index.md file. This can be used for seeing how the configurations were made and what commands were utilized.
