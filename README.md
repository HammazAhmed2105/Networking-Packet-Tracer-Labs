# Networking-Packet-Tracer-Labs
This repo will have several labs on packet tracer.
I decided to do these labs as a mini project after I cleared my CCNA in August 2024. 

**How to use this repository**
1 - There are several fully functional packet tracer lab files along with their respective word files. The word files contain all the explanation of the lab and what all I performed, how I subnetted, commands for VLans, asigning IP ADdresses and much more.
2 - You can download these files and practice yourselves, and you can also check connectivity between different end devices present in the lab, to see if it works.
